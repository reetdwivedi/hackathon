    <h1>What's hackathon?</h1>
    <div class="content">
        A hackathon, also known as a codefest, is a social coding event that brings computer programmers and other
        interested people together to improve upon or build a new software program.

        The word hackathon is a portmanteau of the words hacker, which means clever programmer, and marathon, an event
        marked by endurance.

        The concept of the hackathon, also called a hack day or hack fest, was born out of the open source community.
        The first event labeled a hackathon was the OpenBSD Hackathon in Calgary, Canada, on June 4, 1999.

        Today, engineering departments, especially those at web-based companies, adopt the practice as a way of
        introducing intrapreneurship into the enterprise. Hackathons are sometimes undertaken to achieve a specific
        goal, but often they are a chance for businesses to pursue employee-driven, out-of-the-box ideas in a low-risk
        environment. Employees are given the freedom and support to collaborate with colleagues in other departments
        within a given timeframe and without the pressure of having to produce a viable product.
